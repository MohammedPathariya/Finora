âœ… Completed Phases
Phase 1: Backend Foundation & Data Pipeline
You've successfully built a backend that is far more robust than the original plan.

Flask App Structure: Clean routes/ and services/ structure is in place.

Core API Endpoints: /health, /onboard, /chat, and /api/etfs/market-data are all live and functional.

Hybrid Data System: Instead of just one API, you built a superior system using Yahoo Finance for historical data and FMP for live prices.

Database Caching: You have a smart scraping script and a normalized Supabase database that efficiently caches historical data.

CORS: Is fully configured and working.





Phase 2: Frontend UI & Core Logic
All the foundational UI components and pages are built and connected.

React Components: The Onboarding, Dashboard, Chat, and MarketDataPage are all complete.

State-Based Navigation: The app correctly navigates between all pages.

UI/UX Polish: The app has a consistent brand identity (Finora logo, colors), and includes key UX features like loading states, error handling, and client-side caching.





Phase 3: Intelligent Recommendation & Projection Engine
This is the "brains" of your application, and it's fully operational.

Nuanced Recommendation Engine: You replaced the simple risk-level mapping with an intelligent engine that uses a user's entire profile to generate a truly personalized portfolio.

Data-Driven Projections: You replaced the mock projections with a Monte Carlo simulation that runs on the user's actual recommended portfolio.

Full Backend Integration: The dashboard is now 100% data-driven, fetching both the recommendation and projections in a single, efficient API call.












ðŸš€ Next Phases: What's Remaining

Now that the core application is built, the remaining work is focused on adding high-impact features and preparing for launch.

Phase 4: Advanced Data Visualization
The goal is to visually represent the rich historical data you've collected.

Install a Charting Library: Choose and install a library like Recharts or Chart.js (npm install recharts).

Create a Historical Performance Chart: Build a new component that displays a line chart of an ETF's price over the last year.

Integrate Charts: Add this new chart component to the MarketDataPage (perhaps in a modal when a user clicks a row) and to the Dashboard for each recommended ETF.





Phase 5: Implementing Core User Actions
This phase focuses on making the action buttons on the dashboard functional.

"Download Plan PDF": Create a backend endpoint that takes a portfolio and generates a simple PDF report that the user can download.

"Connect Your Brokerage Account": Research and integrate a service like Plaid that allows users to securely connect their financial accounts. This is a very advanced feature.

"Schedule a Call": Link this button to an external scheduling service like Calendly.





Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment
The final step is to prepare the project for the public.

Write the README: Create a detailed README.md file with setup instructions, screenshots, and a description of how the application works.

Deploy the Backend: Deploy your Flask application to a cloud service like Render or Heroku.

Deploy the Frontend: Deploy your React application to a service like Vercel or Netlify.

Final Configuration: Update the API URLs in your frontend code to point to your live backend server.
