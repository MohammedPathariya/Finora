Phase 1 – Backend Foundation
1. Setup Flask App Structure
Finalize folder structure: routes/, services/, models/

Add basic routes for:

/health → returns API status

/recommend → will later provide investment recommendations

/chat → for AI-based Q&A


2. Integrate Stock Market Data APIs
Choose an API (Finnhub, Alpha Vantage)

Write a service module in services/stock_service.py to:

Fetch ETF/stock data (price, performance, etc.)

Support fetching historical data for charts

3. Implement Simple Portfolio Recommendation Logic
Map risk levels → ETF allocation logic

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def recommend_portfolio(risk_level):
    if risk_level == "low":
        return {"BND": 70, "VTI": 30}
    elif risk_level == "medium":
        return {"VTI": 60, "QQQ": 40}
    ...
4. Set up Flask-CORS and Test API
Ensure React can call Flask endpoints

Test endpoints with curl or Postman




Remaining Stuff:

Make Projections Data-Driven: The "Projections" tab on your dashboard still uses a hardcoded mock function (generateProjections). The next logical step is to create a new backend endpoint that takes the user's recommended portfolio and runs a real financial projection (like a Monte Carlo simulation) to generate more accurate future-looking data.

Add Advanced Visualizations (Charts): Your original plan mentioned using Recharts or Chart.js. You now have a rich set of historical data for over 100 ETFs. A great next feature would be to add a historical performance line chart to the Market Data page or for each ETF in the user's portfolio.

Implement Core User Actions: The action buttons on the dashboard ("Connect Your Brokerage Account", "Download Plan PDF", "Schedule a Call") are currently placeholders. Building out this functionality would be the next major phase of development.









Phase 2 – Frontend Base Setup
5. Initialize React Components
Create main pages:

Onboarding Form (collect age, income, risk level)

Dashboard (display recommendations)

Chat Interface (for AI Q&A)

Set up React Router for navigation

6. Connect Frontend to Backend
Use axios or fetch to call /recommend API

Display portfolio suggestions and allocations visually (using Recharts or Chart.js)

Phase 3 – AI Chat and Explanation Engine
7. LLM Integration
Use OpenAI API (or free Hugging Face LLM)

Create /chat endpoint:

Takes user question

Sends it to LLM with context (risk level, data)

Returns a plain-language answer

8. “Explain-This” Feature
User clicks on ETF name → React calls /chat with
"Explain what [ETF] is and why it fits a [risk-level] investor"

Display AI response in a modal or side panel

Phase 4 – Simulator and UI Polish
9. Investment Growth Simulator
Backend function to calculate future value (compound interest formula or CAGR)

Endpoint /simulate → returns year-by-year data

Frontend → line chart for visualization

10. UI/UX Polish
Brand as Finora (logo, colors, typography)

Add tagline and hero section

Smooth interactions (loading states, success messages)

Phase 5 – Documentation and Deployment
11. README and Project Docs
Full instructions: setup, running, screenshots

Include project description and tagline

12. Deployment
Deploy frontend to Vercel

Deploy backend to Render

Update URLs in frontend API calls

Add demo link to GitHub
